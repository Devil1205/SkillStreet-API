About The Implementation:

Backend:
I have created created a clean server folder structure and added comments for anyone's reference. Used node.js as the backend along with express.js to setup the server and routes. Also used various npm packages like cors, mongoose etc.

Database:
I have used mongodb as the database to store all the notes. To integrate mongodb in the nodejs, I have used mongoose.
For deployment purpose I have used mongodb atlas whose URI is present in .env for security purposes. To test api endpoints, visit the deployed URL.
